This GitHub is where I showcase my journey into the tech world, highlighting the skills I’ve gained along the way. Currently, I'm advancing my expertise as a Cybersecurity student at Southern New Hampshire University. I've completed the Azure Cybersecurity Analyst certification and the CourseCareers IT Professional program. I’m currently working towards earning my CompTIA+ certification. My experience spans incident response, MITRE ATT&CK, and Linux, all while prioritizing a low digital footprint.
